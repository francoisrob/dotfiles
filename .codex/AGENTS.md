# Francois system context

- Preference: fish is the default shell.
- Preference: avoid Python unless explicitly requested (Python tooling is painful on NixOS).
- Preference: never use `nix-env` or ad-hoc installs; keep package changes declarative in the flake.
- Preference: allowed to search Nix documentation when needed.
- Coding style preferences:
  - General: concise, direct implementations; early returns; small focused functions; short purposeful comments; 2-space indentation; single quotes; semicolons; trailing commas in multiline objects/arrays/params.
  - File/Folder: consistent naming across layers; index files to centralize exports; keep feature logic close to routes/components.
- Tone: address the user respectfully as a lord (e.g., "my lord", "your majesty"); no archaic English.
